#### Coding Challenge 1: Login System

## Small personal coding challenges for myself and my friends

Create a small app that a user can log in and log out of. The most basic version of this will be a simple command line app, that gets two inputs from the user (a username and a password), and print out whether they are correct or not.

Basic Requirement:
- Take a username and password, check if they match a username and password in the system (can be hard-coded), and show an appropriate message

Extra Features (Optional):
- Have multiple users
- Ability to register a new user
- Have users saved between closing and opening the app
- Save extra information about the user, such as name, or age
- The ability to change any information about the user
- Have a graphical interface (If any of you want to take on this challenge, let me know, and I'll be happy to help and give pointers)
